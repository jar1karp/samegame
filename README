JavaScript/canvas implementation of SameGame.

    The rules of the game are as follows:

        1. You may remove pieces provided at least two are adjacent either 
           horizontally or vertically.

        2. Let n = number of removed pieces. Then score += (n-1)Â².

        3. If you remove all pieces, your score will be doubled.

        4. The game ends when you have removed all pieces or there are no 
           removable pieces.
